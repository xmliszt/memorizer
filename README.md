## Introduction
Memorizer is a Vue website running on GitHub Page that uses Google Firestore as database. It uses the [Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) to auto-calculate your revision schedule.

You can create two types of revision cards:

1. Q&A: the standard type of revision card that provides a question and an answer.
2. Link: special revision card which accepts a valid URL as the resource. When you revise this kind of card, simply click the link to be directed to the source. **If your link is a YouTube video link, it can be played on the website itself as embedded link**

## What's New!
- Added search bar for memories. Now you can search to find the memory you want quickly!
